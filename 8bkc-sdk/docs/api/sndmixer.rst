PocketSprite Sound Mixer
------------------------

The PocketSprite SDK comes with a sound mixer and decoder, capable of decoding mono wave files and
music modules in .mod/.s3m/.xm format. It can decode and play multiple of these files simultaneously,
mixing them using different volumes.

(ToDo: detail memory use, note that .xm is more intensive than .mod/.s3m)
