uGUI adapter
------------

The PocketSprite SDK comes with a version of `uGUI <https://github.com/achimdoebler/UGUI>`_. This is a library
to easily render text and GUI elements to a screen on an embedded device. The SDK comes with some adapter
logic to easily integrate this library into a PocketSprite application.
